# V0 "Classic"
This is the first draft version of zzip (working title at the start of the project).
It is here primarily to show how the early program worked when it was still a learning tool
for compression algorithms and the Zig language.
It will work as intended but will not give very good results.
This version will remain in production for a finite number of new releases to maintain backwards compatibility for anyone that
came on very early in the development but may eventually be removed.
Please don't judge me too much by this package (feel free to on the other ones);
I was designing as I coded it and learning the language at the same time.
