Compression utility written as an excuse to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org).
Also a fun intro to simple compression concepts like [RLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)
and [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).
Once it's up and running will publish the standard quick-guides and other stuff like that.
